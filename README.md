DressMe Clothing Marketplace (DCM) System has been created for DressMe Clothing Sdn. Bhd. Its main purpose is to place an order, view order, add a new cloth, search for a type of clothing, move back and forth between the clothes that are for sale. Select clothes to order, checkout order, move back and forth between orders (prioritize orders that require delivery), modify an order, delete an order. Doubly linked lists have been implemented using a C++ programming language to build this system.
